# CRISPR_HUSH_lib
A repository for my summer project in the Weissman Lab that involves the use of genome-wide perturb-seq data to identify genes with poor % knockdown for every gRNA targetted by CRISPRi and designing a gRNA sublibrary that can allow its users to target those guides. Supervised by Alex LeNail and Tessa Bertozzi.
